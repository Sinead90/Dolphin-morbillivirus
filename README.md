# Dolphin-morbillivirus

The aim of this project was to model the spatiotemporal spread of dolphin morbillivirus amongst bottlenose dolphins in the Northwestern Atlantic, from 2013 - 2014. This repository inludes the final paper resulting from this project, the data used in all associated analysis, and the supplementary material. 


## Data files

'**Historical_strandings_1989-2013.csv**' contains the historical stranding data from 1989 - 2013.
    * Stranding data were obtained from the NOAA MMHSRP National Stranding Database (accessed 23 May 2014 and 30 June 2014).
    * Data cover the period 1989 - 2013 and from latitudes 27 - 42 N.
    * "Latitude" represents the latitude band within which the stranding was observed (so latitude 27 corresponds to the band 27 - 28 N etc).
    * Each row represents a unique common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) stranding, with information about the observed location and time indicated across the columns.

'**UME_strandings_2013-2014.csv**' contains the stranding data from the recent UME (2013 - 2014).
    * Raw data were obtained from the NOAA MMHSRP National Stranding Database (accessed 23 May 2014 and 30 June 2014).
    * Data cover the period 1989 - 2013 and from latitudes 27 - 42 N.
    * Each cell represents the number of common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) strandings observed during the corresponding day (columns) and latitude band.
    * Data cover a period of one year, starting 26th June 2013
